            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Kaylyn Robinson and I am learning how to code. I graduated from UCF with a Bachelor's in Science under the Rosen College of Hospitality. I have worked in the restaurant and entertainment industry for the last 15 years. However, I am ready for a career change! After working at Google as an Event Manager for the last 4 years, I have found an interest in coding. With some self taught experience in web design and introductory level knowledge in front-end coding, I felt confident enough to take the next step in switching to a career in coding/ programming through enrolling in this coding bootcamp.</p>
